Create a static website on AWS S3 using Terraform:

Steps---

1.  Create an 53 Bucket: Start by creating an 53 bucket to store your website files. The bucket name should be globally unique across all AWS accounts

2. Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting: In the $3 bucket properties, enable static website hosting and specify the default index document (eg. "index.html") and optional error document (eg.. "error.html").

3. Upload Website Files: Upload your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to the S3 bucket. Make sure to set appropriate permissions (e.g., "public-read") for the objects to make them publicly accessible.

4. Enable Public Access: Allow public access to the S3 bucket and its objects by configuring the bucket policy or Access Control Lists(ACLS)

5. Configure DNS (Optional): If you want to use a custom domain for your website (eg. www.yourdomain.com), you can set up a DNS record using Route 53 or any other DNS provider. This step is optional if you are using the default $3 website endpoint.

6. Testing the Website: Once the setup is done, you can test your static website by accessing it through the 53 bucket website URL or your custom domain.
